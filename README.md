                                                              Introduction
This project is about synthesising a dataset. Tasks to be carried out include creating and/or identifying a dataset from a real-world phenomenon of choice, investigating variables, distributions, the relationships between each other, simulation or synthesising and analysis.
 
                                            About the dataset The COVID-19 Coronavirus data
                                            
The COVID-19 Coronavirus data is a dataset containing data on the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide. It contains 12 variables including dateRep, day, month, year, cases, deaths, countriesAndTerritories, geold, countryterritoryCode, popData2019, continentExp, and Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000. It has 57641(Excel format) entries.

These are: Numpy for mathematics or numerical operations; Matplotlib.pyplot for plotting; Pandas for data manipulation and analysis; Seaborn for data visualisation; Jupyter Notebook for text, code, and visualisations; and Python programming language for the execution of all instructions.

The research detail part contains steps on how I proceeded. These include:                                                              
                                                             
                                                              Analysis

                                                              Distributions
A bell-curve plot is displayed on the above histogram and reproduced on the outputs of other variables while using the distributions function gumbel () as below.

                                                              Relationships
There is an agglutination of points between 0-150 (x-axis) and 0-7(y-axis) suggesting close relationship between cases and deaths at the beginning of the pandemic. This output is reproduced with other applied functions as above, particularly with scatter function and regression function where an almost simple regression line is displayed within the plot to suggest this relationship. Vertical dots are positioned near the middle of the plot at 3.80 1e7 (x-axis) and around 7(y-axis). This is reproduced on all plots as above regardless of the function used.

                                                              Simulation
Simulation of dataset coupled with an exponential distribution displayed and this is applicable for the first and second variables. Variations on y-axes while x-axes remain constant for the 3rd and 1st variables. This trend is reversed on the second variable output: x-axis 0.0-17.5 and y-axis (0.0-20). Please see below.

                                                              Conclusion
In conclusion, I have demonstrated how to synthesise and/or simulate a dataset as required in the problem statement. I have selected four variables of interest from the dataset, and investigated their relationships between each other, distributions and simulation. Analyses have shown existence of relationships and variations. Simulation reflected closely the actual dataset properties.
