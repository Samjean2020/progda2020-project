                                                              Introduction
This project is about synthesising a dataset. Tasks to be carried out include creating and/or identifying a dataset from a real-world phenomenon of choice, investigating variables, distributions, the relationships between each other, simulation or synthesising and analysis.
 
                                            About the dataset The COVID-19 Coronavirus data
                                            
The COVID-19 Coronavirus data is a dataset containing data on the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide. It contains 12 variables including dateRep, day, month, year, cases, deaths, countriesAndTerritories, geold, countryterritoryCode, popData2019, continentExp, and Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000. It has 57641(Excel format) entries.                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                              Prerequisites                                                      
These are: Numpy for mathematics or numerical operations; Matplotlib.pyplot for plotting; Pandas for data manipulation and analysis; Seaborn for data visualisation; Jupyter Notebook for text, code, and visualisations; and Python programming language for the execution of all instructions.

The research detail part contains steps on how I proceeded. These include: dataset investigation, analysis, distributions, relationships and simulations.                                                                                   
                                                             
                                                             Conclusion
                                                             
In conclusion, I have demonstrated how to synthesise and/or simulate a dataset as required in the problem statement. I have selected four variables of interest from the dataset, and investigated their relationships between each other, distributions and simulation. Analyses have shown existence of relationships and variations. Simulation reflected closely the actual dataset properties.
