                                                              Introduction
This project is about synthesising a dataset. Tasks to be carried out include creating and/or identifying a dataset from a real-world phenomenon of choice, investigating variables, distributions, the relationships between each other, simulation or synthesising and analysis.
 
                                            About the dataset The COVID-19 Coronavirus data
                                            
The COVID-19 Coronavirus data is a dataset containing data on the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide. It contains 12 variables including dateRep, day, month, year, cases, deaths, countriesAndTerritories, geold, countryterritoryCode, popData2019, continentExp, and Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000. It has 57641(Excel format) entries.
